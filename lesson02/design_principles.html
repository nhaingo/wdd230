                    On this page, visual hierarchy is defined by the use of different font size 
                    and white space that are strategical to attract the attention of the reader. 
                    Also the color contrast of the text indicate what is important. As viewers might not pay attention to every details,
                    the use of visual hierarchy here helps to enhance what are essentials. On this example, the text "Source to you" 
                    with a bigger font-size compare to the next text paragraph is where the author wants to attract the attention first. The green color
                    used here is considered as well a visual hierarchy because it acts like a focal point.

                    This image represents an example of contrast on a website. The fact that the background of the image is darker
                    and the foreground is brighter means that the attention of the viewer is caught to some important elements that must be seen first.
                    Using the Gold color for the text on the first picture is a great use of contrast. Also, on the top of the website,
                    designing it in green with a contrast of white text color is visually appealing.

                    This page uses alignment to position several elements. It brings to the page a sensation of unity and a well organized design.
                    It also gives some sort of connection to each element. While, the fact that the elements are perfectly aligned doesn't really catch the viewer's attention, 
                    the way it is displayed makes them stop and look further. Here, all the pictures are aligned in the same vertical position that could easily catch the view of the reader.
