            </h2>
            <p>
              Montserrat is a versatile font and can be used in multiple domains, one of the reason I chose to use it for my paragraph. It gives a friendly look to my website. 
              I like it also because it is easy to read. All the characters have the same width. 
              This font suits more my website main purpose and is supported by many browsers..
